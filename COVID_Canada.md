Exploring COVID-19 Infections In Canada
================
Stephen Pierzchajlo

# Introduction

I have used R for a few years now, and every project I am currently
working on has a completed R script already made. Therefore, it didn’t
make sense for me to just redo my analyses. I decided I wanted to do
something new for this course, and do something I had never done before.
One aspect of programming that I never was comfortable with was writing
functions. So the ultimate goal of this project is to write functions
that will perform an entire analysis in an interesting way, while still
staying within the parameters of the assignment.

## My project idea

Many months ago I analysed data for a paper on COVID-19. The paper is
currently under review, but all analyses, data, and scripts can be found
here: <https://osf.io/c8zhn/>. Additionally, the github repository for
this project can be found here:
<https://github.com/StephenPierzchajlo/COVID-19---Canada>. Part of my
work involved getting COVID-19 infection rate data for 4 specific weeks
in March/April to use as a random effects parameter in a multiple
regression model. The specific COVID-19 repository I found gets updated
daily and contains data for every country in the world. I thought it
would be interesting to create a set of functions that could be used to
analyse COVID-19 data for any country in a variety of ways, and output
COVID-19 related statistics and visualisations of infection trends. This
idea will be the goal of the current project.

<br/>

In this project, I will first analyse COVID-19 data for 1 country in
great detail, and then automate these analyses using functions I created
that generalise across any country I want to see. Because I am Canadian,
I decided to first analyse Canadian COVID-19 data in as much detail as
possible. This will include downloading the data from a specific source,
wrangling it into a condensed dataframe, graphing the data in various
ways, and even doing some basic modelling to predict future infection
rates.

# Preparations

Here is how I typically start any R project.

## Remove global environment

I usually remove the global environment each time I open my project.

``` r
# This function removes the entire global environment!!!
rm(list = ls())
```

<br/>

## Load packages

Below is a list of packages I will use for my project. I comment on each
one to indicate what they will be used for.

``` r
# Load packages.

# Contains all tidyverse functions for data wrangling and graphing.
library(tidyverse)

# Additional visualisation features for daily COVID-19 infections.
library(gghighlight)

# Summarising data into a condensed dataframe.
library(plyr)

# Theme for ggplot that I like. Must be installed via github. Use the line that is commented out below if you need to install the package first.
#devtools::install_github('Mikata-Project/ggthemr')
library(ggthemr)

# The ggarrange function from ggpubr plots multiple graphs.
library(ggpubr)

# Clean regression summary and display coefficients for predictive models.
library(broom)

# Create documentation for functions.
library(docstring)
```

## Set Root Directory

I want my images to save in the results folder. The code chunk below
will set this to my default output folder.

``` r
# Set directory for image ouput.
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = paste0('C:\\Users\\STPI0560\\Desktop\\R Projects\\COVID-19---Canada\\results'))
```

<br/>

# Data Wrangling

## Finding a COVID-19 repository

Their are many different COVID-19 data repositories, and I am using two
files that contain COVID-19 data for every country in the world. File 1
contains data about total worldwide cases and file 2 contains data about
total worldwide deaths. Each time the code chunk below is run, it grabs
each *.csv* file from a github repository that has been updated within
the past 24 hours. This is ideal, because it means that anytime I run
this script, I have COVID-19 statistics that are as recent as yesterday.
I prefer this approach to downloading a static *.csv* file because
COVID-19 cases and deaths are ongoing and constantly changing.

``` r
# Load .csv files from github. These are updated daily, so everytime this analysis is run, it uses the most up to date information.

# Load total global cases data.
COVID_Global_Wide <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv"))

# Load total global deaths data.
COVID_Global_Deaths_Wide <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv"))
```

<br/>

## Quick look at raw data

First I’ll look at the overall shape of one of these dataframes, since I
already know they both have the exact same structure.

``` r
# Print number of rows and columns.
cat(" There are", nrow(COVID_Global_Wide), "rows in this dataframe.\n","There are", ncol(COVID_Global_Wide), "columns in this dataframe.")
```

    ##  There are 274 rows in this dataframe.
    ##  There are 453 columns in this dataframe.

There are a massive number of columns. Why is that? I decided to take a
look at the overall structure of one of the dataframes.

``` r
# Display first 10 rows and all columns.
COVID_Global_Wide[1:10, ]
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 453
    ##    `Province/State`  `Country/Region`   Lat   Long `1/22/20` `1/23/20` `1/24/20`

    ## #   4/22/20 <dbl>, 4/23/20 <dbl>, 4/24/20 <dbl>, 4/25/20 <dbl>, 4/26/20 <dbl>,
    ## #   4/27/20 <dbl>, 4/28/20 <dbl>, 4/29/20 <dbl>, 4/30/20 <dbl>, 5/1/20 <dbl>,
    ## #   5/2/20 <dbl>, 5/3/20 <dbl>, ...

As seen above, the *.csv* file has been arranged such that each column
is a date (ignoring the first 4 columns), with values in a column
corresponding to the total cases/deaths up until that date. This format
is not easy to work with, and it means a new column will appear every
day. After 1 week this dataframe will have 7 more columns.

<br/>

## Reshaping dataframes

To make the data easier to work with, I will create one column called
“date” where each row is a date. In a column beside it, I will have
the total cases/deaths for that date. Now instead of 100s of columns
that contain dates, there is instead a single dates column.

``` r
# Total global cases data in long format.
COVID_Global_Long_Date <- gather(COVID_Global_Wide, date, cases, 5:ncol(COVID_Global_Wide), factor_key=TRUE)

# Total global deaths data in long format
COVID_Global_Deaths_Long_Date <- gather(COVID_Global_Deaths_Wide, date, cases, 5:ncol(COVID_Global_Deaths_Wide), factor_key=TRUE)
```

``` r
# Take a look at several of the first rows of the long-format cases dataframe.
head(COVID_Global_Long_Date)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 6
    ##   `Province/State` `Country/Region`      Lat   Long date    cases
    ##   <chr>            <chr>               <dbl>  <dbl> <fct>   <dbl>
    ## 1 <NA>             Afghanistan          33.9  67.7  1/22/20     0
    ## 2 <NA>             Albania              41.2  20.2  1/22/20     0
    ## 3 <NA>             Algeria              28.0   1.66 1/22/20     0
    ## 4 <NA>             Andorra              42.5   1.52 1/22/20     0
    ## 5 <NA>             Angola              -11.2  17.9  1/22/20     0
    ## 6 <NA>             Antigua and Barbuda  17.1 -61.8  1/22/20     0

``` r
# Take a look at several of the first rows of the long-format deaths dataframe.
head(COVID_Global_Deaths_Long_Date)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 6
    ##   `Province/State` `Country/Region`      Lat   Long date    cases
    ##   <chr>            <chr>               <dbl>  <dbl> <fct>   <dbl>
    ## 1 <NA>             Afghanistan          33.9  67.7  1/22/20     0
    ## 2 <NA>             Albania              41.2  20.2  1/22/20     0
    ## 3 <NA>             Algeria              28.0   1.66 1/22/20     0
    ## 4 <NA>             Andorra              42.5   1.52 1/22/20     0
    ## 5 <NA>             Angola              -11.2  17.9  1/22/20     0
    ## 6 <NA>             Antigua and Barbuda  17.1 -61.8  1/22/20     0

Now both dataframes contain only a single column for dates. This will be
much easier to work with in R.

<br/>

## Combining dataframes

Since both dataframes come from the same source, they might have the
same structure. If so, I could just attach the deaths column from the
second dataframe to the first dataframe. Below I loop through both
dataframes simultaniously, and for each column check how many rows have
matching information in the same position, and how many have
non-matching information. The loop will do this for all pairs of columns
between the two dataframes except for the cases/deaths columns (since
those are expected to have different information). If there are any
differences between rows in each column pair, I should get some
**FALSE** statments outputted by the loop. If there are no differences,
I should have a single loop output that says **TRUE**.

``` r
# Check whether the cases and deaths dataframes have exactly the same information per row for each column pair (except actual cases/deaths).
for(i in length(colnames(COVID_Global_Long_Date)) - 2){
  
  print(table(COVID_Global_Long_Date[[i]] == COVID_Global_Deaths_Long_Date[[i]]))
  
}
```

    ## 
    ##   TRUE 
    ## 122577

Everything matches, so I’m going to add the cases column from the deaths
dataframe to the cases dataframe. Additionally, I’ll call this new
column “deaths”.

``` r
# Combine death count to cases dataframe.
COVID_Global_Long_Date$deaths <- COVID_Global_Deaths_Long_Date$cases
```

Now, I can quickly check the dataframe to see how it looks.

``` r
# See first few rows of ammended dataframe.
head(COVID_Global_Long_Date)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 7
    ##   `Province/State` `Country/Region`      Lat   Long date    cases deaths
    ##   <chr>            <chr>               <dbl>  <dbl> <fct>   <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 <NA>             Afghanistan          33.9  67.7  1/22/20     0      0
    ## 2 <NA>             Albania              41.2  20.2  1/22/20     0      0
    ## 3 <NA>             Algeria              28.0   1.66 1/22/20     0      0
    ## 4 <NA>             Andorra              42.5   1.52 1/22/20     0      0
    ## 5 <NA>             Angola              -11.2  17.9  1/22/20     0      0
    ## 6 <NA>             Antigua and Barbuda  17.1 -61.8  1/22/20     0      0

Now I only need to work with this single dataframe instead of 2.

<br/>

## Filtering provinces

Because I only want Covid-19 data from Canada, I need to filter out
every other non-Canadian country from the new dataframe.

``` r
# Subset Canadian provinces from total cumulative global cases data.
Covid_Canada <- subset(COVID_Global_Long_Date, `Country/Region` == "Canada")
```

I can then check how many provinces I have in the filtered dataframe.

``` r
# See how many provinces are in the dataset.
unique(Covid_Canada$`Province/State`)
```

    ##  [1] "Alberta"                   "British Columbia"         
    ##  [3] "Diamond Princess"          "Grand Princess"           
    ##  [5] "Manitoba"                  "New Brunswick"            
    ##  [7] "Newfoundland and Labrador" "Northwest Territories"    
    ##  [9] "Nova Scotia"               "Nunavut"                  
    ## [11] "Ontario"                   "Prince Edward Island"     
    ## [13] "Quebec"                    "Repatriated Travellers"   
    ## [15] "Saskatchewan"              "Yukon"

<br/>

Now there are only 16 provinces in this dataframe, covering every
Canadian province (Actually, their are 10 provinces and 3 territories.
This dataframe lists 2 quarantined cruise ships and something called
Repatriated Travellers). I only want to focus on the most populated
regions in Canada, since many territories have extremely small
populations. Therefore, I will focus on the 8 largest Canadian
provinces, which will be subsetted below.

``` r
# List of provinces.
Province_List <- c("Ontario", "Quebec", "New Brunswick", "Manitoba", "British Columbia", "Saskatchewan", "Alberta", "Newfoundland and Labrador")

# Filter dataframe according to list above.
Covid_Canada <- Covid_Canada %>%
  filter(`Province/State` %in% Province_List)
```

Now I can double-check the number of provinces in my further filtered
dataframe.

``` r
# See how many provinces are in the dataset.
unique(Covid_Canada$`Province/State`)
```

    ## [1] "Alberta"                   "British Columbia"         
    ## [3] "Manitoba"                  "New Brunswick"            
    ## [5] "Newfoundland and Labrador" "Ontario"                  
    ## [7] "Quebec"                    "Saskatchewan"

Looks good\!

<br/>

I also want to filter dates so that the dataframe starts around the time
COVID-19 started getting really bad. I do that below, and then print the
date from the first row of the filtered dataframe.

``` r
# Filter Canadian provincial data to start around the beginning of March 2020.
Covid_Canada <- Covid_Canada[352:nrow(Covid_Canada), ]

# Check first row of date column,
Covid_Canada[1,5]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   date  
    ##   <fct> 
    ## 1 3/5/20

Now the dataframe starts around the beginning of March. This was a bit
before quarantines started occurring, so I think this is good enough.

<br/>

## Converting dates

Looking at the data below…

``` r
# Check data structure.
str(Covid_Canada)
```

    ## tibble [3,241 x 7] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ Province/State: chr [1:3241] "Saskatchewan" "Alberta" "British Columbia" "Manitoba" ...
    ##  $ Country/Region: chr [1:3241] "Canada" "Canada" "Canada" "Canada" ...
    ##  $ Lat           : num [1:3241] 52.9 53.9 53.7 53.8 46.6 ...
    ##  $ Long          : num [1:3241] -106.5 -116.6 -127.6 -98.8 -66.5 ...
    ##  $ date          : Factor w/ 449 levels "1/22/20","1/23/20",..: 44 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 ...
    ##  $ cases         : num [1:3241] 0 1 21 0 0 0 25 2 0 2 ...
    ##  $ deaths        : num [1:3241] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...

…the date variable is a factor. R allows you to have date variables, so
I want to change all dates to be variables of this type.

``` r
# Convert date column to date format.
Covid_Canada$date <- as.Date(Covid_Canada$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Display date variable type.
str(Covid_Canada$date)
```

    ##  Date[1:3241], format: "0020-03-05" "0020-03-06" "0020-03-06" "0020-03-06" "0020-03-06" ...

Now the dates are formatted as actual date variables

<br/>

## Subsetting dataframe

I don’t need the Country/Region, Lat, or Long columns, so I’m going to
get rid of them.

``` r
# Take only a subset of columns.
Covid_Canada <- subset(Covid_Canada, select = c("Province/State", "date", "cases", "deaths"))
```

<br/>

## Daily cases/deaths calculation

The Covid-19 cases and deaths data are cumulative, so each row
represents the total cases or deaths up to that date. If I want cases
per day, I need to add new columns where each row subtracts the current
day’s cases/deaths from the previous day. Below I make two new columns
that only have cases/deaths for that day. To do that I take a value from
one row, and subtract it from the previous row.

``` r
# Calculate cases per day by subtracting current count in each row by total cases up until that point.
Covid_Canada$DailyCases <- ave(Covid_Canada$cases,Covid_Canada$`Province/State`,  FUN=function(x) c(0, diff(x)))

# Calculate deaths per day by subtracting current count in each row by total deaths up until that point.
Covid_Canada$DailyDeaths <- ave(Covid_Canada$deaths,Covid_Canada$`Province/State`,  FUN=function(x) c(0, diff(x)))
```

<br/>

## Per Capita Correction

Because I am comparing provinces, absolute cases/deaths will be
misleading since different provinces have different population sizes. I
am going to add a new column using case\_when() that gives cases/deaths
per 100,000 people. I had to look up the population for each province,
and then I divided cases/deaths in each province by the province’s
population, and multiplied it by 100,000.

``` r
# Calculate total cases in each province per 100,000 people.
Covid_Canada$Cases_Per100000 <- as.numeric(case_when(Covid_Canada$`Province/State` == "Alberta" ~ (Covid_Canada$cases/4345737) * 100000,
                                                     Covid_Canada$`Province/State` == "British Columbia" ~ (Covid_Canada$cases/5020302) * 100000,
                                                     Covid_Canada$`Province/State` == "Manitoba" ~ (Covid_Canada$cases/1360396) * 100000,

# Graphs

## Total cases/deaths in each province.

I want to first see the total cases/deaths in each province. I decided
to make a stacked bar graph where each bar represents total cases in a
province. Each bar is seperated by the proportion of cases to deaths.
The x-axis displays total cases, and I put text beside each bar to
display just the total deaths per province.

``` r
# Set Theme.
ggthemr("flat")

# average data in dataframe for graphing.

  ddply(c("`Province/State`"), summarise,
        cases = sum(DailyCases),
        deaths = sum(DailyDeaths)) %>%
  gather(Category, Number, cases:deaths) %>%
  
  # Graph total cases and deaths per province, tilt sideways, stack cases/deaths, display cases count on x-axis/death count above each bar.
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`Province/State`, Number), y = Number, fill = factor(Category, levels = c("deaths", "cases")))) +

# Modelling

Because the assignment calls for some sort of analysis, I decided to try
some predictive modelling using this dataset. While this dataset lends
itself much better to qualitative analysis, I have seen many COVID-19
models that try to predict future cases based on current infection
trends. I have never done anything like this before, but I thought this
might be a good way to learn how.

<br/>

## Data Preparation

First, I made a new dataframe for predictive modelling, since I will
need to add future dates to it.

``` r
# Make modelling dataframe.
Covid_Canada_Modelling <- Covid_Canada
```

<br/>

I also want to make a prediction model for all of Canada, not one for
each province. Thus, I need to summarise the data by date so that each
day averages over all cases/deaths for every province.

``` r
# Average cases per day, for all provinces.
Covid_Canada_dates <- Covid_Canada_Modelling %>%
  ddply(c("date"), summarise,
        cases = mean(cases),
        deaths = mean(deaths),
        DailyCases = sum(DailyCases),
        DailyDeaths = sum(DailyDeaths))
```

<br/>

## Create future predictions dataframe

Most researchers who try to predict future COVID-19 cases use more
complicated models with many parameters to account for things like
lockdowns, mask compliance, etc. I don’t have any predictors like that
in the current dataset, so it will be hard to predict anything too far
into the future. However, even with a single potentially mediocre
predictor like date, I may be able to get an accurate estimate of very
short-term trends. Therefore, I will try to predict COVID-19 cases for
the next 10 days. To do this, I’m going to make a new dataframe that has
the next 10 days after the most recent date today. I will also add blank
columns that match the main dataframe so that I can bind the rows of
this dataframe to the other one later.

``` r
# New dataframe that starts the final day of COVID data collection and adds 10 days. Also contains blank columns for other variables.
New_Dates <- data.frame(date =seq(max(Covid_Canada_Modelling$date),max(Covid_Canada_Modelling$date) + 10,by='days'),
                        cases = NA,
                        deaths = NA,
                        DailyCases = NA,
                        DailyDeaths = NA)

# View future dates dataframe.
head(New_Dates)
```

    ##         date cases deaths DailyCases DailyDeaths
    ## 1 0021-04-14    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 2 0021-04-15    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 3 0021-04-16    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 4 0021-04-17    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 5 0021-04-18    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 6 0021-04-19    NA     NA         NA          NA

The dataframe just contains a column of future dates, and NA’s for all
other columns. One issue is that this dataframe starts on the last day
that COVID-19 data has been collected, since I created the dates by
starting with the last date on the main dataframe. So I will just delete
the first row from this new dataframe.

``` r
# Delete first row.
New_Dates = New_Dates[-1,]

# Look at first few rows.
head(New_Dates)
```

    ##         date cases deaths DailyCases DailyDeaths
    ## 2 0021-04-15    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 3 0021-04-16    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 4 0021-04-17    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 5 0021-04-18    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 6 0021-04-19    NA     NA         NA          NA
    ## 7 0021-04-20    NA     NA         NA          NA

Now the dataframe starts on the **NEXT** day.

<br/>

Next, I add this dataframe to the modelling dataframe.

``` r
# Add future dates to end of modelling dataframe.
Covid_Canada_dates <- rbind(Covid_Canada_dates, New_Dates)

# Look at last 15 rows of ammended dataframe.
tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 15)
```

    ##            date    cases  deaths DailyCases DailyDeaths
    ## 402  0021-04-10 132198.0 2899.75       7484          34
    ## 403  0021-04-11 133161.5 2902.75       7708          24
    ## 404  0021-04-12 134500.4 2908.00      10711          42
    ## 405  0021-04-13 135426.8 2912.25       7411          34
    ## 406  0021-04-14 136550.6 2919.50       8991          58
    ## 2100 0021-04-15       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 3100 0021-04-16       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 410  0021-04-17       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 510  0021-04-18       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 610  0021-04-19       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 710  0021-04-20       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 810  0021-04-21       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 910  0021-04-22       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 1010 0021-04-23       NA      NA         NA          NA
    ## 1110 0021-04-24       NA      NA         NA          NA

Now the dataframe contains future dates as well.

<br/>

## Data modelling

Next I need to define the actual model I will use to make predictions.
Unfortunately, I don’t have any useful predictors other than date, and
just using a date to predict the number of COVID-19 cases is probably a
severely lacking approach. Still, using current infection trends from
the past might be a good way to estimate very near future infection
rates (like infections 5-10 days from now). Therefore, I will set up a
model that only uses date to predict infections for the next 10 days. I
will do this using a series of models, starting with an overly
simplistic one.

<br/>

### Naive model

I first fit a very naive model. This model uses a single predictor
(dates), and uses data from the past 300 days of Covid-19 infections. It
has no other parameters, and thus, lacks flexibility.

``` r
# Somewhat naive linear model.
model.1 <- lm(data = tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 300), cases ~ date)
```

<br/>

I can look at a summary of the coefficients I estimated for this model,
and print out an interpretation.

``` r
# Model summary.
tidy(model.1, conf.int = T)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 7
    ##   term          estimate  std.error statistic   p.value   conf.low  conf.high
    ##   <chr>            <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept) 332807899. 5518689.        60.3 2.15e-165 321945821. 343669977.
    ## 2 date              467.       7.75      60.3 2.24e-165       452.       483.

``` r
# Print coefficient interpretation.
print(paste0("For every 1 day increase over the past 300 days, we would expect an additional ", round(tidy(model.1, conf.int = T)[2,2], 2), " new Covid-19 infections"))
```

    ## [1] "For every 1 day increase over the past 300 days, we would expect an additional 467.41 new Covid-19 infections"

<br/>

### Prediction

I now have a simple model, so I will apply those coefficients to the
future dates so I can make predictions. This is the model:

``` r
# Print predictive model summary with coefficients.
print(paste0("cases = ", round(tidy(model.1, conf.int = T)[1,2], 2), " + ", round(tidy(model.1, conf.int = T)[2,2], 2), " * date"))
```

    ## [1] "cases = 332807899.26 + 467.41 * date"

This model can be used to predict new cases, by simply inputing the
current dates into the regression equation and then using the output as
the prediction. The code below calculates these new values.

``` r
# Predict COVID-19 infections with my model.

Each value above represents predictions of total COVID-19 case for the
next 10 days. I can quickly see how close my predictions are to the
actual COVID-19 cases for those dates, as well as see what the model’s
future predicitons are by looking at the final 15 of the dataframe.

``` r
# Look at predictions for future dates, as well as predictions for the 5 most rcent days of real data.
data.frame("Date" = tail(Covid_Canada_dates$date, n = 15),
           "Actual Cases" = tail(Covid_Canada_dates$cases, n = 15),
           "Predicted Cases" = tail(Covid_Canada_dates$New, n = 15))

Comparing the actual cases to cases predicted by the model leaves some
error. I’ll plot the regression line over the data to see why the model
might be giving poor predictions.

``` r
# Plot data and future predictions regression lne.
ggplot(data = tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 300), aes(x = date, y = cases)) + 
  geom_point(color='blue')  +
  geom_line(color='red',data = tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 300), aes(x=date, y=New))
```

The regression line (red) extends beyond the data (blue), so it’s
definitely predicting future infections. But, the model isn’t a very
good fit as the straight line doesn’t fit the non-linear data very well.
It also seems to be underpredicting Covid-19 infections from January on.
This is probably because a single-degree regression model with just one
predictor doesn’t allow for any flexibility if the data are even
slightly non-linear. To account for this, I will instead try and fit a
series of polynomial models that can increasingly account for the
non-linearity seen in the data. Polynomials can fit non-linear data, but
there is always a concern that they will overfit the data if given too
much freedom (i.e. fit to the idiosyncracies of the sample rather than
model the data generating mechanism).

<br/>

## Polynomial models 1

In the code chunk below, I will repeat the steps I performed above, but
this time fit a series of polynomial models. This will be done in a for
loop, from 1 degree to 8 degrees. Finally, I will plot each model
against the data in a single graph.

``` r
# Make 8 polynomial models, graph them, and collect adjusted R-Square value for each model.
for(i in 1:8){
  
  # Make modelling dataframe. 
  Covid_Canada_dates <- Covid_Canada
  
  # Average cases per day, for all provinces.
  Covid_Canada_dates <- Covid_Canada_dates %>%
    ddply(c("date"), summarise, 
          cases = mean(cases), 
          deaths = mean(deaths),
          DailyCases = sum(DailyCases),
          DailyDeaths = sum(DailyDeaths))
  
  # New dates dataframe.
  New_Dates <- data.frame(date =seq(max(Covid_Canada_dates$date),max(Covid_Canada_dates$date) + 30,by='days'),
                          cases = NA,
                          deaths = NA,
                          DailyCases = NA,
                          DailyDeaths = NA)
  
  # Delete first row.
  New_Dates = New_Dates[-1,]
  
  # Add future dates to end of modelling dataframe.
  Covid_Canada_dates <- rbind(Covid_Canada_dates, New_Dates)
  
  # Fit increasingly comlex polynomials.
  model.1 <- lm(data = tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 300), cases ~ poly(date, i))

  # Predict COVID-19 infections with each polynomial model.
  Covid_Canada_dates$New <-  predict(object = model.1, newdata = Covid_Canada_dates)
  
  # Assign new name to each graph I make below.
  assign(paste0("Graph", i),
         
         # Plot data and polynomial regression line.
         ggplot(data = tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 300), aes(x = date, y = cases)) + 
           geom_point(color='blue')  +

           theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10)) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
           geom_line(color='red',data = tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 300), aes(x=date, y=New)))
  
  # Get Adjusted R-Squared value for each polynomial and assign it a new name.
  assign(paste0("Adj", i), summary(model.1)$adj.r.squared)
  
  # Model Summary.
  assign(paste0("Model_Coeffs", i),broom::tidy(model.1, conf.int = T))
  

  
}

# Create array of graphs.
ggarrange(Graph1, Graph2, Graph3, Graph4, Graph5, Graph6, Graph7, Graph8) %>%
  
  # Annotate multiple graphs.
  annotate_figure(top = text_grob("Predicting Next 10 Days Of COVID", color = "black", face = "bold", size = 14))
```

Each model fits differently, with some models fitting the data better
than others, and some models making what appear to be more reasonable
future predictions.. However, these models may also be severly
overfitting to the data, which one would expect as more parameters are
added to a model. In addition, I decided that using dates from the past
8 months might not be best when trying to assess short term trends in
infection rates. For instance, infections from 8 months ago have far
less bearing on future trends than do infections from 2 weeks ago.
Therefore, I am going to instead fit these polynomials to only a small
number of days in the past.

<br/>

## Polynomial models 2

Here I will repeat the loop above, but this time predict the next 10
days of infection using only the previous 30 days as a predictor.

``` r
# Make 8 polynomial models, graph them, and collect adjusted R-Square value for each model.
for(i in 1:8){
  
  # Make modelling dataframe.

    ddply(c("date"), summarise,
          cases = mean(cases),
          deaths = mean(deaths),
          DailyCases = sum(DailyCases),
          DailyDeaths = sum(DailyDeaths))
  
  # New dates dataframe.
  New_Dates <- data.frame(date =seq(max(Covid_Canada_dates$date),max(Covid_Canada_dates$date) + 10,by='days'),

Some of the higher order polynomial fits seem to be making absurdly
unbelievable future predictions. However, some of the lower-order
polynomial models look reasonable. I’m going to focus on the 3-order
polynomial because it looks like the most reasonable fit, and pretend it
was the model I thought was best. Below, I will repeat the original
fitting process used for the naive model, but this time use the 3-order
polynomial to fit only the past 30 days of COVID-19 infections.

``` r
# Make modelling dataframe.
Covid_Canada_Modelling <- Covid_Canada

# Average cases per day, for all provinces.
Covid_Canada_dates <- Covid_Canada_Modelling %>%
  ddply(c("date"), summarise,
        cases = mean(cases),
        deaths = mean(deaths),
        DailyCases = sum(DailyCases),
        DailyDeaths = sum(DailyDeaths))

# New dataframe that starts the final day of COVID data collection and adds 20 days. Also contains blank columns for other variables.
New_Dates <- data.frame(date =seq(max(Covid_Canada_Modelling$date),max(Covid_Canada_Modelling$date) + 10,by='days'),
                        cases = NA,
                        deaths = NA,
                        DailyCases = NA,
                        DailyDeaths = NA)

# Delete first row.
New_Dates = New_Dates[-1,]

# Add future dates to end of modelling dataframe.
Covid_Canada_dates <- rbind(Covid_Canada_dates, New_Dates)

model.2 <- lm(data = tail(Covid_Canada_dates, n = 30), cases ~ poly(date, 3))

# Predict COVID-19 infections with my model.
Covid_Canada_dates$New <-  predict(object = model.1, newdata = Covid_Canada_dates)

# Model summary.
tidy(model.2, conf.int = T)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 7
    ##   term           estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>             <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)     132638.      291.   456.    2.38e-34  132022.   133254.
    ## 2 poly(date, 3)1   48549.     2151.    22.6   1.47e-13   43990.    53108.
    ## 3 poly(date, 3)2    5017.     1640.     3.06  7.51e- 3    1539.     8495.
    ## 4 poly(date, 3)3    -768.      785.    -0.979 3.42e- 1   -2433.      896.

Now to predict cases, each date is multiplied by the intercept and the 3
polynomial coefficients. Like before, I can apply these coefficients to
each new date and get a new COVID-19 infection total for that day in the
future.

``` r
# Look at predictions for future dates.
data.frame("Date" = tail(Covid_Canada_dates$date, n = 15),
           "Actual Cases" = tail(Covid_Canada_dates$cases, n = 15),
           "Predicted Cases" = tail(Covid_Canada_dates$New, n = 15))
```

    ##          Date Actual.Cases Predicted.Cases
    ## 1  0021-04-10     132198.0        132157.9
    ## 2  0021-04-11     133161.5        133207.3
    ## 3  0021-04-12     134500.4        134282.2
    ## 4  0021-04-13     135426.8        135381.9
    ## 5  0021-04-14     136550.6        136505.0
    ## 6  0021-04-15           NA        137650.2
    ## 7  0021-04-16           NA        138816.1
    ## 8  0021-04-17           NA        140001.0
    ## 9  0021-04-18           NA        141202.8
    ## 10 0021-04-19           NA        142419.4
    ## 11 0021-04-20           NA        143648.5
    ## 12 0021-04-21           NA        144887.4

    ## 15 0021-04-24           NA        148632.8

The predicted data matches the actual cases pretty closely for days that
have case data. Thus, the future predictions might now be a little bit
more accurate.

<br/>

It should be stressed, however, that this model still probably isn’t
very good. A more accurate model would need many more predictors, and I
would probably assess overfitting using a process like cross-validation
to compute model variance out of sample. But for this assignment, I will
leave this as it is.

<br/>

# Functions

The dataset I used contains data from every country in the world, not
just Canada. If I wanted to make new graphs and perform new analyses on
another country, I would have to painstakingly replace each code chunk
with new inputs and re-run everything. I decided to make some functions
that not only repeat the analyses I did for Canada, but allow me to
simply add the country I want to the function, and instantly get up to
date COVID-19 graphs and statistics for that country.

<br/>

## Country\_List()

When using these functions, it will be useful to get a list of names of
countries that can be used. This first function takes no arguments, and
simply outputs a list of all countries I could choose from.

``` r
Country_List <- function(){
  
  #'@title Country_List: finding countries for COVID-19 plotting in R.
  #'
  #'@author Stephen Pierzchajlo
  #'
  #'@description Function that returns a list of countries
  #' 
  #'@usage Country_List()
  #'
  #'@details This function contains no arguments. The user simply types the function as 
  #'outlined above under Usage, and recieves a list of all countries in the world that can 
  #'be used with other subsequent functions.
  
  # Make package list.
  packages <- c('tidyverse')    
  
  # Install packages not yet installed
  installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
  
  if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
    
    install.packages(packages[!installed_packages], repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com"))
    
    }
  
  # Packages loading
  invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))

  
  # Total Global Cases Data
  x <-read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv"))
  
  # Total global cases data in long format.
  COVID_Global_Long_Date <- gather(x, date, cases, 5:ncol(x), factor_key=TRUE)
  
  # compute all unique countries and return a list.
  return(unique(COVID_Global_Long_Date$`Country/Region`))
  
}
```

## COVID\_Country\_Data()

This function outputs the number of cases and deaths up until the
current date in the country inputted into the function. It is only a
text output, and probably is not that important since the next function
will output a graph, but I thought it was nice to include this in case I
want to just quickly see a country’s statistics.

``` r
COVID_Country_Data <- function(country){

  ### Some countries have provinces, others don't. The strategy I am using to make the dataframes for entire country
  ### won't work in both instances. So we need to apply averaging differently.
  
  # If Province/State is empty:
  if(is.na(Covid$`Province/State`) == TRUE){
    
    # Calculate cases per day by subtracting current count in each row by total cases up until that point.
    Covid$DailyCases <- ave(Covid$cases,Covid$`Country/Region`,  FUN=function(x) c(0, diff(x)))
    
    # Calculate deaths per day by subtracting current count in each row by total deaths up until that point.

```

## COVID\_Country\_Graph()

This function plots a countries total COVID-19 cases and deaths in a
side-by-side bar graph.

``` r
COVID_Country_Graph <- function(country){

# Testing Each Function

Here I am going to use each function as if I had not done any of the
previous work in this R project. So, I will first delete everything that
has been done up to this point.

``` r
# This function removes the entire global environment!!!
rm(list = ls())
```

Next, I will load the docstring package manually since it cannot be
loaded from inside a function. The docstring package allows you to add
documentation to a function. THis next code chunk checks whether the
package is installed. If it is, nothing happens. If it isn’t, R installs
the package. Finally, docsting is loaded into the current library.

``` r
# Create documentation for functions.
# Make package list.
packages <- c('docstring')    
  
# Install packages not yet installed
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())

if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages], repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com"))
  
  }

# Packages loading
invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))
  
library(docstring)
```

## Source Functions

I made 5 functions, so I will link to their directories so they can be
automatically called.

``` r
# Source Country_List()
source("C:\\Users\\STPI0560\\Desktop\\R Projects\\COVID-19---Canada\\bin\\Country_List.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# Source COVID_Country_Data()
source("C:\\Users\\STPI0560\\Desktop\\R Projects\\COVID-19---Canada\\bin\\COVID_Country_Data.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# Source COVID_Country_Graph()
source("C:\\Users\\STPI0560\\Desktop\\R Projects\\COVID-19---Canada\\bin\\COVID_Country_Graph.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# Source COVID_Cumulative_Graph()
source("C:\\Users\\STPI0560\\Desktop\\R Projects\\COVID-19---Canada\\bin\\COVID_Country_Cumulative_Graph.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# Source COVID_Country_Daily_Graph()
source("C:\\Users\\STPI0560\\Desktop\\R Projects\\COVID-19---Canada\\bin\\COVID_Country_Daily_Graph.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```

## Trying Functions Out

Here I will try the functions out with a few countries other than Canada
to see what the output looks like. First, I will look at the list of
countries and pick a few.

There are 192 countries I can use with the next 4 functions. From the
list above, I will pick a few countries. Israel has seen cases plummet,
so I would like to see what their data look like. Brazil has seen an
exponential rise in cases, so I would like to see their cases as well.

``` r
# Get COVID-19 statistical output for Israel and Brazil.
COVID_Country_Data(Israel)
```

    ##   Country/Region Category Number
    ## 1         Israel    cases 836590
    ## 2         Israel   deaths   6312

``` r
COVID_Country_Data(Brazil)
```

    ##   Country/Region Category   Number
    ## 1         Brazil    cases 13673507
    ## 2         Brazil   deaths   361884

<br/>

Next, I’m going to plot bar graphs that give the same data as the
function above.

``` r
# Plot bar graphs of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Israel and Brazil.
COVID_Country_Graph(Israel)
```

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%203-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
COVID_Country_Graph(Brazil)
```

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%203-2.png)<!-- -->

<br/>

Now, I will plot cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths in Israel and
Brazil.

``` r
COVID_Country_Cumulative_Graph(Israel)
```

    ## [[1]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%204-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## 
    ## [[2]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%204-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
COVID_Country_Cumulative_Graph(Brazil)
```

    ## [[1]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%204-3.png)<!-- -->

    ## 
    ## [[2]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%204-4.png)<!-- -->

<br/>

Finally, I will plot daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in Israel and
Brazil.

``` r
COVID_Country_Daily_Graph(Israel)
```

    ## [[1]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%205-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## 
    ## [[2]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%205-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
COVID_Country_Daily_Graph(Brazil)
```

    ## [[1]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%205-3.png)<!-- -->

    ## 
    ## [[2]]

![](COVID_Canada_files/figure-gfm/test%20function%205-4.png)<!-- -->

<br/>

In addition to these functions, I have also included simple
documentation to go along with each one. For instance, the user of these
functions could review the Country\_List() function to see how to use it
like this: ?Country\_List(). I can’t display the output in R Markdown,
but when used in R Studio, documentation for each function appears in
the right pane under the Helper tab.

# Future Work

I am hoping to add more flexibility to these functions. First, I want to
add a time machine option. COVID-19 will eventually be over, so the data
will eventually be of historical importance. Therefore, I want to add an
argument that lets you pick a date, and then the function will pretend
you are looking at the data at that date in time. I also want to let
people compare different countries on the same graph, sort of like I did
with the province comparision graphs. However, this would require a per
capita transformation of cases to account for large population
differences. This would be a big undertaking, and not one I want to do
for this assignment. I also didn’t have the functions output
side-by-side cases/deaths graphs because the assigment wanted to
functions to output 2 pieces of information. However, it would be more
asthetically correct to do so, and I plan on implimenting a feature like
this as well.
