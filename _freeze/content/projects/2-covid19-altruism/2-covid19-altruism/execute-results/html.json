Imminence refers both to spatial proximity (whether something is far or close in space), as well as temporal proximity (something happening weeks from now versus something happening now). Distal (unpredictable) threats are typically associated with risk assessment and appraisal strategies, and usually trigger states of generalised stress. Conversely, imminent (predictable) threats trigger rapid avoidance responses and are usually associated with states of acute anxiety and panic (Blanchard & Blanchard, 1990; Fanselow & Lester, 1988; Mobbs et al., 2020). Importantly, there is recent evidence suggesting that defensive states triggered by imminent danger may promote altruistic motivation (Vieira et al., 2020a).\n\nThe data I will be analysing comes from a recent study (Vieira et al., 2020b) conducted by Dr. Joana Vieira at Karolinska Instiutet to test how COVID-19 threat imminence impacts acts of everyday altruism. The pandemic represented a unique proxy for threat imminence as the number of cases and deaths were increasing exponentially and therefore represented a constantly approaching threat. Joana hypothesised that increased COVID-19 threat over time would be associated with an increase in self-reported altruistic acts. She predicted that measurements associated with imminent threats during the pandemic would be associated with an increase in altrustic acts, while measurements associated with distal threats during the pandemic would not be associated with self-reported altruism.\n\nA paper is currently being prepared for publication (Vieira et al., 2020b) using data for my current project here, but the paper uses only frequentist analyses. I thought this would be the perfect dataset to try a complimentary Bayesian analysis and use some techniques learned in class. Additionally, the Bayesian analyses performed here will be included as a suppimentary manuscript that readers can access via the Open Science Framework (osf.io) to compare with the frequentist analysis.\n\n## Data Collection\n\nData for this analysis came from a study conducted online between March 24th and April 14th of 2020. Each week, 150 different people from the United States were surveyed about a range of self-reported behaviours and psychological states. Therefore, a total of 600 people were included in the study, collected over 4 data acquisition periods. For the purposes of this analysis, only the measurements directly associated with the Bayesian model will be discussed. The dependent measure for this study was each participants' self-reported altruism (SRA) score. The main predictors we collected and had hypotheses related to were: COVID-19 Risk Perception (RP), Percieved Stress Score (PSS), Anxiety, and Depression. We also collected each participants' age, gender, employment status, and financial situation. These latter 4 predictors had no prior hypothesis tied to them, but we thought each could contribute to predicting SRA. Later, each predictor will be very briefly described as it relates to the hypothesis.\n\n## COVID-19 Data Aquisition\n\nTo get a sense of where the United States was in terms of overall COVID-19 cases during our data acquisition period, I obtained COVID-19 related data from github for those 4 weeks. I then created a dataframe that contains only the weeks for which the data for the experiment took place. The code chunk below puts this dataframe together.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gghighlight)\nlibrary(plyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(rethinking)\nlibrary(ggmcmc)\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# Here, we load .csv files from github.

Each row is data collected from one participant, and also contains data about the number of cases and deaths for the week the data was collected for the State each participant comes from. There are many additional variables as well that are not important for the current analysis.\n\n## Measurement Scales\n\nTheir were 5 major scales that make up the dependent and independent measures used in the survey study, and they will briefly be discussed here. The Self-Reported Altruism Scale (SRA; Rushton et al., 1981) asks participants to rate the frequency with which they engaged in various altruistic acts. COVID-19 Risk Perception (RP) was assessed using a modified scale from Wise et al. (2020) and asks participants about their percieved risk of COVID-19 related infection and related personal/financial worries. Defensive emotions were indexed via the Percieved Stress Scale (PSS-10; Cohen et al., 1983) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). The PSS-10 asks participants about experiences of stress related to unpredictable and uncontrollable events in their lives. The DASS-21 contains an anxiety scale related to acute anxiety/panic and autonomic arrousal. The DASS-21 also contains questons related to experienced depressive episodes, and these depression-related questions are also included as a seperate predictor in the model.\n\nBelow, I created some graphs to help visualise the distribution of scores for each measure. These are simply to help visualise how participants responded, and contain the responses from all 600 individuals.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter questionnaires only.\nCVA_Subset <- CVA[, c(\"PS1\", \"PS2\", \"PS3\", \"PS4\", \"PS5\", \"PS6\", \"PS7\", \"PS8\", \"PS9\", \"PS10\", \"D1\", \"D2\", \"D4\", \"D6\", \"D7\", \"D8\", \"D9\", \"D11\", \"D12\", \"D14\", \"D15\", \"D18\", \"D19\", \"D20\", \"RP1\", \"RP2\", \"RP3\", \"RP4\", \"RP5\", \"RP6\", \"RP7\", \"RP8\", \"RP9\", \"RP10\", \"SRA1\", \"SRA2\", \"SRA3\", \"SRA4\", \"SRA5\", \"SRA6\", \"SRA7\", \"SRA8\", \"SRA9\", \"SRA10\", \"SRA11\", \"SRA12\", \"SRA13\", \"SRA14\", \"SRA15\", \"SRA16\", \"SRA17\", \"SRA18\", \"SRA19\", \"SRA20\")]\n\n#Reverse scored item PS4.\nCVA_Subset$PS4 <- ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS4 == \"0\", 4,\n                    ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS4 == \"1\", 3,\n                           ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS4 == \"2\", 2,\n                                  ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS4 == \"3\", 1, 0))))\n\n#Reverse scored item PS5.\nCVA_Subset$PS5 <- ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS5 == \"0\", 4,\n                    ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS5 == \"1\", 3,\n                           ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS5 == \"2\", 2,\n                                  ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS5 == \"3\", 1, 0))))\n \n#Reverse scored item PS7.\nCVA_Subset$PS7 <- ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS7 == \"0\", 4,\n                    ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS7 == \"1\", 3,\n                           ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS7 == \"2\", 2,\n                                  ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS7 == \"3\", 1, 0)))) \n\n#Reverse scored item PS8.\nCVA_Subset$PS8 <- ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS8 == \"0\", 4,\n                    ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS8 == \"1\", 3,\n                           ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS8 == \"2\", 2,\n                                  ifelse(CVA_Subset$PS8 == \"3\", 1, 0))))\n\nCVA_PS <- CVA_Subset[, 1:10]\nCVA_D <- CVA_Subset[, 11:24]\nCVA_RP <- CVA_Subset[, 25:34]\nCVA_SRA <- CVA_Subset[, 35:54]\n\nCVA_PS_Long <- gather(CVA_PS, key = PS, value = \"Measure\", PS1:PS10)\nCVA_D_Long <- gather(CVA_D, key = D, value = \"Measure\", D1:D20)\nCVA_RP_Long <- gather(CVA_RP, key = RP, value = \"Measure\", RP1:RP10)\nCVA_SRA_Long <- gather(CVA_SRA, key = SRA, value = \"Measure\", SRA1:SRA20)\n\n# PSS graphing dataframe.\nCVA_PS_Long$Question <- case_when(\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS1\" ~ \"How often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS2\" ~ \"how often have you felt you were unable to control the important things in your life?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS3\" ~ \"how often have you felt nervous and stressed?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS4\" ~ \"how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS5\" ~ \"how often have you felt that things were going your way?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS6\" ~ \"how often have you found that you could not cope with all the things you had to do?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS7\" ~ \"how often have you been able to control irritations in your life?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS8\" ~ \"how often have you felt that you were on top of things?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS9\" ~ \"how often have you been angered because of things that were outside your control?\",\nCVA_PS_Long$PS == \"PS10\" ~ \"how often have you felt difficulties were pilling up so high that you could not overcome them?\",\nTRUE ~ as.character(CVA_PS_Long$PS)\n)\n\nCVA_PS_Long$Answer <- case_when(\nCVA_PS_Long$Measure == 0 ~ \"1.

The line fit to each plot is a simple linear regression line fit to each week and is not based on a random effects linear model.

Because we never covered it in class, I ended up getting quite lost using the rethinking package to accomplish this. Because the R package brm has a slew of vignettes associated with the model I wanted to build (and Statistical Rethinking does not really have many), I opted to use the brm package instead. Thankfully, Solomon Kurz provides an excellent re-imagining of Statistical Rethinking using brm on his blog, so I was able to still mirror most analyses and graphs in Statistical Rethinking using the brm package.

Centering all continuous data fixed the issue. In keeping with the spirit of the initial analysis, I have also opted to center all variable. I have also tested this model without centering, and the posterior estimates are very similar (albeit of a different scale). However, uncentered estimates come with a huge swath of divergent transitions anyway, and centering the data reduced this effect substantially. Therefore, it makes sense to center everything before building the model.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCVA_Bayes$SRA_C <- scale(CVA_Bayes$SRA, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)\nCVA_Bayes$RP_C <- scale(CVA_Bayes$RP, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)\nCVA_Bayes$PSS_C <- scale(CVA_Bayes$PSS, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) # Distal\nCVA_Bayes$Anxiety_C <- scale(CVA_Bayes$Anxiety, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) # Proximal\nCVA_Bayes$Depression_C <- scale(CVA_Bayes$Depression, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)\nCVA_Bayes$Age_C <- scale(CVA_Bayes$Age, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## A Note About My Priors\n\nBecause I did not have a lot of prior knowledge about the measures used in the study, I wanted to keep my priors as uncertain as possible. Becuase we collected a lot of data, I figured that the priors would probably be drowned out by the likelihood anyway. Of special note, the prior I chose for correlations between elements in the variance-covarince matrix (lkj_corr_cholesky) is set to 1, meaning extreme correlations are more likely a priori. While it might make sense to set this higher (because maybe extreme correlations are actually less likely a priori), the examples I have seen that use this prior set it to 1, and it does not seem to change anything if I set it higher.\n\n## Initial Model In Mathematical Notation\n\nHere is the initial model I fit. The model contains parameters for the intercept (SRA), Risk Perception (RP), Perceived Stress (PSS), Anxiety (A), and Depression (D). The model also has a random intercept accounting for SRA scores for each of the four weeks, and a random slope for each of the four predictors accounting for changes per each of the four weeks. State was also initially considered as a random effect, but the model became too complicated and would crash R if it was run. Removing the random effect of State fixed the issue. We would likely require more data from each State to use it in the model.\n\n$$SRA_{i} \\sim Normal(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma)$$ $$\\mu_{i} \\sim \\alpha_{week[i]} + \\beta RP_{week[i]}RP_{i} + \\beta PSS_{week[i]}PSS_{i} + \\beta A_{week[i]}A_{i} + \\beta D_{week[i]}D_{i}$$ $$\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha_{week}\\\\ \\beta_{week} \\end{bmatrix} \\sim MVNormal \\begin{pmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha\\\\ \\beta_{i} \\end{bmatrix} , S\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ $$S = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sigma_{\\alpha} & 0\\\\\n0 & \\sigma_{\\beta}\n\\end{pmatrix} \nR \\begin{pmatrix}\\sigma_{\\alpha} & 0\\\\\n0 & \\sigma_{\\beta}\n\\end{pmatrix} $$ $$\\alpha \\sim Normal(0, 1)$$ $$\\beta \\sim Normal(0, 1)$$ $$\\sigma \\sim Cauchy(0, 1)$$ $$\\sigma_{\\alpha} \\sim Cauchy(0, 1)$$ $$\\sigma_{\\beta} \\sim Cauchy(0, 1)$$ $$R \\sim LKJ_{corr}(1)$$ $$LKJ_{corr} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\rho_{\\beta_{RP}\\alpha} & \\rho_{\\beta_{PSS}\\alpha} & \\rho_{\\beta_{A}\\alpha} & \\rho_{\\beta_{D}\\alpha}\\\\\n\\rho_{\\alpha\\beta_{RP}} & 1 & \\rho_{\\beta_{PSS}\\beta_{RP}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{A}\\beta_{RP}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{D}\\beta_{RP}}\\\\\n\\rho_{\\alpha\\beta_{PSS}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{RP}\\beta_{PSS}} & 1 & \\rho_{\\beta_{A}\\beta_{PSS}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{D}\\beta_{PSS}}\\\\\n\\rho_{\\alpha\\beta_{A}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{RP}\\beta_{A}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{PSS}\\beta_{A}} & 1 & \\rho_{\\beta_{D}\\beta_{A}}\\\\\n\\rho_{\\alpha\\beta_{D}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{RP}\\beta_{D}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{PSS}\\beta_{D}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{A}\\beta_{D}} & 1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n# Statistical Analysis\n\n## Initial Statistical Model\n\nBelow I tested the main model used in the original frequestist analysis. Unseen here, my initial model had a very large proportion of samples flagged as divergent. Therefore, I increased the adapt_delta parameter, starting at 0.96. This parameter affects the step-size of the Hamiltonian MCMC algorithm, and increasing it is akin to decreasing the size of a step taken by the algorithm during optimisation. While this action lowers the number of transitions that result in the energy of the Hamiltonian system not being constant (i.e. divergency), it can also make it less likely that the algorithm samples from harder to reach places of the posterior (like the tails for instance). Therefore, I increased the number of samples to 25,000 and the number of chains to 4. Once I identify the best adapt_delta configuration, the samples will be increased for the final model, and only one chain will be used.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Full COVID model.\nCOVID_Bayes_0.96 <- brm(SRA_C~ 1 + RP_C + PSS_C + Anxiety_C + Depression_C  + (1+ RP_C + PSS_C + Anxiety_C + Depression_C|Week), data=CVA_Bayes,\n           family = gaussian(),\n           prior = c(\nprior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept),\nprior(normal(0, 1), class = b, coef = \"RP_C\"),\nprior(normal(0, 1), class = b, coef = \"PSS_C\"),\nprior(normal(0, 1), class = b, coef = \"Anxiety_C\"),\nprior(normal(0, 1), class = b, coef = \"Depression_C\"),\nprior(cauchy(0,2), class = sd, group = Week, coef = Intercept),\nprior(cauchy(0,2), class = sd, group = Week, coef = \"RP_C\"),\nprior(cauchy(0,2), class = sd, group = Week, coef = \"PSS_C\"),\nprior(cauchy(0,2), class = sd, group = Week, coef = \"Anxiety_C\"),\nprior(cauchy(0,2), class = sd, group = Week, coef = \"Depression_C\"),\nprior(cauchy(0,2), class = sd),\nprior(lkj_corr_cholesky(1), class = cor),\nprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sigma)),\nfile = \"C:/Users/STPI0560/Desktop/Website/content/projects/2-covid19-altruism/models/COVID_Bayes_0.96.rds\",\niter = 25000, warmup = 2000, cores = 4, chains =4, seed = 123, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.96))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are 525 divergent transitions with adapt_delta = 0.96, and I wonder if this can be improved.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCOVID_Bayes_m1_Summary <- tidyMCMC(COVID_Bayes_0.96$fit, conf.int = TRUE, rhat = TRUE, ess = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95,\n              conf.method = \"quantile\", pars = c(\"b_Intercept\", \"b_RP_C\", \"b_PSS_C\",\n                                                 \"b_Anxiety_C\", \"b_Depression_C\", \"sigma\"))\n\nCOVID_Bayes_m1_Summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  term           estimate std.error conf.low conf.high  rhat    ess\n  <chr>             <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl>  <int>\n1 b_Intercept    -0.00368    0.156   -0.321      0.323  1.00  23002\n2 b_RP_C          0.169      0.0980  -0.0180     0.365  1.00  22234\n3 b_PSS_C        -0.145      0.140   -0.410      0.131  1.00   6291\n4 b_Anxiety_C     0.306      0.0995   0.108      0.494  1.00  23620\n5 b_Depression_C -0.168      0.131   -0.418      0.105  1.00  19236\n6 sigma           0.949      0.0278   0.897      1.01   1.00 101914\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI am plotting some of the output, but am not yet interested in the parameter estimates.

Here it is less clear, and may not matter much since the number of divergent transitions is small and they are discarded from the model estimate anyway.

This makes me confident that the final model that uses only 1 chain will converge.\n\n## Effective Sample Size Ratio Test\n\nESS tells us the number of independent samples our samples drawn from a non-random dependent sampler are worth. The central limit theorum bounds uncertainty to the sample size, provided the sampling procedure is random. Hamiltonian MCMC conditions each sample on the previous sample, and so the sampling procedure is not truly random. The less random a sampling procedure is, the less independent samples your depedently drawn samples will be worth. Therefore, looking at the ration between ess and samples drawn is a good diagnistic to assess how bad autocorrelation (non-randomness) is. This is important here, as random effects models can greatly increase autocorrelation.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nratios_cp_fixed <- neff_ratio(COVID_Bayes_0.99, pars = c(\"b_Intercept\", \"b_RP_C\", \"b_PSS_C\", \"b_Anxiety_C\", \"b_Depression_C\"))\nratios_cp_all <- neff_ratio(COVID_Bayes_0.99)\nmcmc_neff(ratios_cp_fixed, size = 2) + yaxis_text(hjust = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmcmc_neff(ratios_cp_all, size = 2) + yaxis_text(hjust = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOverall, these seem ok. I remember Andrew Gelman saying that anything over .1 is fine, although larger ratios are obviously better as it indicates the process is closer to random.

First, all ess values are above 6,000 and all rhat values are approximately 1. Below I have some simple conclusions about the parameter estimates.\n\n-   For every 1-unit increase in COVID-19 risk perception, self-reported altruism increases by 0.17 standard deviations. A very small portion of the 95% credible interval overlaps with zero, so this may be a semi-important predictor.\n-   For every 1-unit increase in perceived stress, self-reported altruism decreases by 0.15 standard deviations. A substantial portion of the 95% credible interval overlaps with zero, so this predictor may not be as important. Or, the size of the effect seems to still have a lot of uncertainty associated with it.\n-   For ever 1-unit increase in anxiety scores, SRA scores increased by 0.30 standard deviations. I interpret this as being the most important predictor in the model, as well as having the largest effect.\n-   Finally, For every 1-unit increase in depression, Self-reported altruism decreases by 0.17 standard deviations. A substantial portion of the 95% credible interval overlaps with zero, so this predictor may not be as important.\n\nAdditionally, I am not saying that some effects are present and others are not (like what might happen during a frequentist analysis). All parameters might be important for predicting SRA. Some might also be more/less important if we control for things that were not measured. But in this current model, anxiety is clearly tied to an estimate with the largest effect, and the most certainty about the direction of the effect.\n\n## Autocorrelation\n\nThe lower rhat ratio displayed earlier might indicate some level of autocorrelation that is unwanted. Because each sample from each chain is dependent upon the previous sample, each second draw from the sampling algorithm will obviously be more correlated with the first draw than the third draw is with the first. This should drop off considerably as the distance increases.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmcmc_acf(posterior_cp, pars = c(\"b_Intercept\", \"b_RP_C\", \"b_PSS_C\", \"b_Anxiety_C\", \"b_Depression_C\"), lags = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nEach row above is a chain, and each column a parameter. Each sample is perfectly correlated with itself (1), and then about 50% correlated with the second dependent draw. This seems to drop off to nearly zero at the 9th or 10th lagged sample. While this is not perfect, I believe that with a large number of samples this should not effect my estimates too much.\n\n## Non-hypothesized predictors model\n\nNext, I wanted to create a model with the other predictors that were collected but not hypothesized: age, gender, employment, and financial situation. My strategy was to fit them in their own model as predictors of SRA, and pull out the predictors that seemed to predict it well. I kept adapt_delta at 0.99 as this worked well in the initial model.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Full COVID model: adaptive delta = 0.99.\nCOVID_Bayes_2nd_0.99 <- brm(SRA_C~ 1 + Age_C + Gender2 +  Employment  + financ + (1 + Age_C + Gender2 +  Employment  + financ|Week), data=CVA_Bayes,\n           family = gaussian(),\n           prior = c(\nprior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept),\nprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sigma)),\nfile = \"C:/Users/STPI0560/Desktop/Website/content/projects/2-covid19-altruism/models/COVID_Bayes_2nd_0.99.rds\",\niter = 25000, warmup = 2000, cores = 4, chains =4, seed = 123, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAs this is exploratory, I decided to let brm find most priors for me during optimisation.

zero as an indicator of anything about the existence of an effect. However, posterior estimates with means/modes that are closer to zero are still less certain about the size and direction of an effect than posteriors further away from zero, and our hypothesis relates to a specific parameter being most important. Above, we can see that the only parameter value where the 95% credible interval of the posterior parameter estimate does not overlap with zero is Anxiety and Age. This at least lends partial evidence that this parameter is a more important predictor of SRA than the others. Although, Risk Perception might be worth looking at more closely in future studies.\n\n## MCMC Traceplots\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolor_scheme_set(\"mix-blue-red\")\nmcmc_trace(COVID_Bayes_Model_2_Final, pars = c(\"b_Intercept\", \"b_RP_C\", \"b_PSS_C\", \"b_Anxiety_C\", \"b_Depression_C\", \"b_Age_C\", \"sigma\"), facet_args = list(ncol = 1, strip.position = \"left\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI plotted the traceplots to ensure the chains look like they are sampling from the entire posterior parameter space.

Briefly, if a model is a good fit for the data, then we should be able to recover the data that generated the model via random sampling of likelihood distributions generated by parameters randomly sampled from the posterior. By drawing random samples from the posterior and then drawing a random data point from a posterior parameter generated likelihood model, a histogram of posterior-generated data should match the actual distribution of the data that generated the posterior model.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- as.numeric(CVA_Bayes$SRA_C)\nyrep <- posterior_predict(COVID_Bayes_Model_2_Final, draws = 500)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolor_scheme_set(\"brightblue\")\nppc_stat(y, yrep, stat = \"mean\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-57-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFirst, we can see a histogram of all draws from the likelihood distributions generated by each random parameter draw from the posterior model.

None-pooling models average over all nested effects so that different clusters (i.e. Weeks in my case) are not accounted for by the model. On the other hand, complete-pooling models make seperate models for each level of a cluster (i.e. Model 1 only accounts for Week 1, Model 2 only accounts for Week 2, etc.) and ignore information about other clusters. Random-effects models employ partial pooling, meaning they simultaniously estimate none-pooled and complete-pooled model, and use both estimates to inform a partial pooled model. As a result, these models tend to be better estimates of the true within-cluster estimate. I decided to try my hand at some plots he made in Chapter 14. However, because I used a different package, my visuals are slightly different.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lme4)\n#> Loading required package: Matrix\n#> Loading required package: methods\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## No pooling model\n\nFirst, I fit a model that does not account for week.

It should appear as though gravity is pulling the estimates towards a center mass of the graph. For the most part, the graphs reflect this, although there are some instances where they either don't shrink closer, or even get further away. I'm not sure why that is the case. Perhaps the models are not optomised properly. Still, there generally does seem to be an advantage for using the partial pooled models. Additionally, I am most interested in seeing the slope parameters shrinking towards the global estimate, which is what I see in almost every arrow (meaning, if we ignore the direction on the x-axis, the arrows point closer to the true estimate on the y-axis most of the time). Or, 13/16 arrows point closer to the pooled parameter estimate than further from it.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_pulled <- bind_rows(df_no_pooling, df_partial_pooling)\n\nggplot(df_pulled) + \n  aes(x = Intercept, y = Slope_RP_C, color = Model) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(data = df_gravity, size = 5) + \n  # Draw an arrow connecting the observations between models\n  geom_path(aes(group = Week, color = NULL), \n            arrow = arrow(length = unit(.02, \"npc\"))) + \n  # Use ggrepel to jitter the labels away from the points\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL), \n    data = df_no_pooling) + \n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL)) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Pooling of regression parameters\") + \n  xlab(\"Intercept estimate\") + \n  ylab(\"RP estimate\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-90-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df_pulled) + \n  aes(x = Intercept, y = Slope_PSS_C, color = Model) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(data = df_gravity, size = 5) + \n  # Draw an arrow connecting the observations between models\n  geom_path(aes(group = Week, color = NULL), \n            arrow = arrow(length = unit(.02, \"npc\"))) + \n  # Use ggrepel to jitter the labels away from the points\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL), \n    data = df_no_pooling) + \n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL)) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Pooling of regression parameters\") + \n  xlab(\"Intercept estimate\") + \n  ylab(\"PSS estimate\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-90-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df_pulled) + \n  aes(x = Intercept, y = Slope_Anxiety_C, color = Model) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(data = df_gravity, size = 5) + \n  # Draw an arrow connecting the observations between models\n  geom_path(aes(group = Week, color = NULL), \n            arrow = arrow(length = unit(.02, \"npc\"))) + \n  # Use ggrepel to jitter the labels away from the points\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL), \n    data = df_no_pooling) + \n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL)) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Pooling of regression parameters\") + \n  xlab(\"Intercept estimate\") + \n  ylab(\"Anxiety estimate\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-90-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df_pulled) + \n  aes(x = Intercept, y = Slope_Depression_C, color = Model) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(data = df_gravity, size = 5) + \n  # Draw an arrow connecting the observations between models\n  geom_path(aes(group = Week, color = NULL), \n            arrow = arrow(length = unit(.02, \"npc\"))) + \n  # Use ggrepel to jitter the labels away from the points\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL), \n    data = df_no_pooling) + \n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = Week, color = NULL)) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Pooling of regression parameters\") + \n  xlab(\"Intercept estimate\") + \n  ylab(\"Depression estimate\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2-covid19-altruism_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-90-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe hypothesized that measures associated with predictable proximal threats (Anxiety) would be the best predictor for SRA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, measures of this type (i.e. autonimic arousal, panic) via the Anxiety questionnaire were most strongly associated with SRA. Conversely, measures associate with distal, more unpredictable threats which bring out feelings more associated with generalised stress did not have as clear an association with SRA. Additionally, age predicted SRA quite will, but this is unsurprising. People generally become more altruistic as they get older (Sisco & Weber, 2019; Willer et al., 2015). As explained before, this analysis was conducted to mirror the frequentist analysis used in a manuscript that is currently a preprint online. While frequentism is generally associated with conclusions made (criticisms aside) with more certainty (i.e. with p-values), the results from this analysis actually match the frequentist conclusions almost identically. Both Anxiety and Age were statistically significant predictors of SRA, while PSS and Depression were not statistically significant. However, Risk Perception was also a statistically significant predictor in the frequentist analysis, while here it appears more uncertain. This difference aside, it appears there is an association between defensive emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic and everyday acts of altruism.\n\n# References\n\nBlanchard, R. J., & Blanchard, D.
